## üõ† Structure:
Our cinema app has a structured architecture that is organized as follows:

<br>`Config`: stores the Spring configuration used by the application.
<br>`Controller`: contains the endpoints for the app's web interface.
<br>`DAO`: the Data Access Layer (Repository) responsible for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
in the database.
<br>`DTO`: a data transfer object that wraps model objects to standardize the requests and responses received and sent 
by controllers.
<br>`Lib`: contains email and password validators with corresponding annotations for convenience.
<br>`Model`: contains the models used by the application to represent entities in the database.
<br>`Service`: contains services that invoke the DAO and Authentication classes for database operations and user 
authentication, respectively.
<br>`Mapper`: converts model objects to DTO objects for smooth data transfer.
<br>`Util`: utility class used to determine DateTime pattern.
